Swirl basics

Typing **skip()** allows you to skip the current question.
Typing **play()** lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
UNTIL you type **nxt()** which will regain swirl's attention.
Typing **bye()** causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
Typing **main()** returns you to swirl's main menu.
Typing **info()** displays these options again.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

install.packages("swirl")
library(swirl)
swirl()
setwd()

```
