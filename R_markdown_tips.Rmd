# Jist of R Markdown
*bold*
**italics**


For those new to R Markdown:
``` {r} 
# install.packages('rmarkdown') # downloads package
# library(rmarkdown) # call package
# you have to use library() function after installing the package
#View(caffeine)
```

R Markdown: Connect to data. Run code. Generate reports.
## Think of as modern day lab notebook where you capture what you DID and what you were THINKING

3 components 
 1. YAML metadata (title, author, data, output) ['yet another markup language']
 2. Text 
 3. Code chunks
 
Shaded area is called a 'chunk'

Three ways to create 'chunk'
  1. (on R script consolue) select Insert (green square with C +) > click 'R' (blue circle) on drop down menu
  2. (on tool bar) Code > Insert Chunk
  3. Manually make chunk ``` {r} ```
      a. ' ` ' symbol is the same key as ' ~ '
      b. type ' ` ' three times
      c. add curly brackets ' { } '
      d. place the letter 'r' inside curly brackets {}
          - there are other items to put inside curly brackets, but we can discuss that later
      e. write code
      f. type ' ` ' three times to end the 'chunk'
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# knitr: allows the R markdown file to be exported as a dynamic report (like a html)
# opts_chunk: local chunk options are merged with default options
# $set : all later chunks will use these options
# echo = TRUE: all code chunks will be included in final rendered version
## All homework assignments should contain this chunk verbage ##
```

      
```{r}
# let's practice running code in 'chunks'
# create variables
x = 2 # x is storing the value 2
y = 6 # y is storing the value 6
# solve an equation with known variables
z = x*y # z will be x times y
print(z) # show the answer for z
```



## When the assignment is completed
  1. *Select* Save (but you should be saving throughout your progress!)
      - either 'File > Save' or click the blue save icon on R window
  2. Click 'Knit' (blue yarn with needles), select 'Knit to HTML'
      - Knit will rerun your code starting from the top, so make sure to load all data and create all objects
      - If there are errors in your code, you may not be able to knit your document until they are fixed
      - You will see the progress of your save in your 'Console'
      - If your knit is successful, your knitted doucument will pop up
          -- it should producce 2 files (1. filename.Rmd , 2. filename.html/pdf)

# What are you suppose to turn in?

Content:
1. Each answer should contain all relevant code to reproduce answer (i.e. loading data, variables, graphs)
~ We will grade on completeness and correctness
~~ Each week there is 1 TA who grades all of the assignments to keep grading consistent

Format:
1. Must use R markdown to complete assingments, not R Script like week 1
2. Must save R markdown file as 1) .html or 2) .pdf
3. Keep it nice & neat = happy TA!
4. Upload .html or .pdf file to gaucho space by Wednesay (we will not accept .Rmd files)
