As long as your HW file

1) YAML - authorship/date/titlle
2) Question in plain text (white bit)
3) code in chunks (grey bit)
4) answer below code chunk 


Setup file should include all data and pacakges you will use for that lab assignment
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# install packages first
#install.packages("readr") # package that helps fun function read_csv
library(readr)

#install.packages("tidyverse") # pacakge that helps tidy up your data
library(tidyverse)

# for every lab, you will need packages 1) readr 2) tidyverse
# always hashtag 'install.packages()' and 'View()'

# rundown of things
## heads up: variable names cannot have 1) spaces, 2) start with numbers

# variable_name <- function(argument)
# data files
battongue <- read_csv("battongues.csv")

```
